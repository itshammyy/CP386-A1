//Question 3:
//Write a C/C++ program that replicates the functionality of the Unix pipeline command
//$ ps xao sid | sort -u | wc -l
//This command counts the number of unique session IDs currently active on the system. Your
//implementation should focus on process creation and file descriptor management. Create three
//separate processes corresponding to each part of the pipeline (ps, sort, and wc). Each process
//should execute the respective command as a new program. Your primary task is to ensure proper
//control and redirection of file descriptors to mimic the behavior of the pipe (|) operator in a Unix
//shell. Remember, the goal is not to reimplement the commands themselves but to orchestrate their
//execution and intercommunication in a C/C++ program.
